                <p class="text-faded">The participants are required to run their VIO algorithms on sequences selected from the public <a href="http://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/uzh-fpv.html">UZH-FPV Drone Racing Dataset</a>, which include images, IMU measurements, and event-based camera data recorded with a FPV drone racing quadrotor flown aggressively by an expert pilot. The goal is to estimate the quadrotor motion as accurately as possible, utilizing any desired sensor combinations.</p>

The evaluation datasets are exactly the same. To obtain the prize money of up to 2000 USD, the winner of this competition will need to outperform the winner from the previous competition as follows:
                <ul style="list-style-type:none">
                    <li>Average translation error below 5&#37; &#8594; 1000 USD</li>
                    <li>Average translation error below 2&#37; &#8594; 2000 USD</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p class="text-faded">The prize money will only be awarded to the single team with the best performance. Evaluation details are provided below. Results and report from the previous year can be found on the dataset website. The winner will also be invited to present his approach at the relevant ICRA 2020 Workshop (TBA).</p>
